### Comets_workshop
This repository has the materials for a workshop introducing FBA and COMETS (Computation Of Microbial Ecosystems in Time and Space). To learn more about COMETS I recommend checking their [website](https://www.runcomets.org/home) and the papers linked there and in the resources document in this repository.

This repository and the materials within are building upon code written by others and I want to give credit where credit is due: 
- *COMETS* is a collaboration between multiple labs and it is mantained by the [Segre Lab](https://github.com/segrelab/comets) at Boston University
- The *CAFBAfy* file (this version) is written mostly by Jean C.C. Vila (https://github.com/vilacelestin) with some minor modifications by me 
- The *FBA tutorial* is a modification (by me) of a tutorial by Jean C.C. Vila

I will keep updating useful resources, but suggestions are welcome.
